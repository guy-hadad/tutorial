# bash

## debugging:
1. when you need to debug your script you should open terminals for each process and see which fail.
2. keep it simple! if some process fail, try to run the same process alone and copy the system enivroment value that run this process successfully for example  PYTHONPATH
3. `$0` will contain a path, absolute or relative to the script.
